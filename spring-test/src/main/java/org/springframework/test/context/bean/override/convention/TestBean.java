/**
 * Mark a field to override a bean instance in the {@code BeanFactory}.
 *
 * <p>The instance is created from a no-arg static factory method in the test
 * class whose return type is compatible with the annotated field. The method
 * is deduced as follows.
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the {@link #methodName()} is specified, look for a static method with
 * that name.</li>
 * <li>If a method name is not specified, look for exactly one static method named
 * with a suffix equal to {@value #CONVENTION_SUFFIX} and starting with either the
 * name of the annotated field or the name of the bean.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Consider the following example.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * class CustomerServiceTests {
 *
 *     &#064;TestBean
 *     private CustomerRepository repository;
 *
 *     // Tests
 *
 *     private static CustomerRepository repositoryTestOverride() {
 *         return new TestCustomerRepository();
 *     }
 * }</code></pre>
 *
 * <p>In the example above, the {@code repository} bean is replaced by the
 * instance generated by the {@code repositoryTestOverride()} method. Not only
 * is the overridden instance injected into the {@code repository} field, but it
 * is also replaced in the {@code BeanFactory} so that other injection points
 * for that bean use the overridden bean instance.
 *
 * <p>To make things more explicit, the method name can be set, as shown in the
 * following example.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * class CustomerServiceTests {
 *
 *     &#064;TestBean(methodName = "createTestCustomerRepository")
 *     private CustomerRepository repository;
 *
 *     // Tests
 *
 *     private static CustomerRepository createTestCustomerRepository() {
 *         return new TestCustomerRepository();
 *     }
 * }</code></pre>
 *
 * <p>By default, the name of the bean to override is inferred from the name of
 * the annotated field. To use a different bean name, set the {@link #name()}
 * attribute.
